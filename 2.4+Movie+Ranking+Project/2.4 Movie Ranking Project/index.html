<h1>The best game of the year 2023 According to Seyhavin</h1> 
<h2>My top 3 games from difference genres.</h2>
<hr>
<h2>Apex Legends</h2>
<p>The best battle royal game in my opinion and it has a lot of play style and movement technics.</p>
<h2>The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt</h2>
<p>The main story is great and other 2 DLC are on fire but I prefer the blood and wine DLC because of the OST and the story as well.</p>
<h2>Counter Strike Source 2</h2>
<p>It is the brand new game from valvue but it is the best fps from the start 1999 that first version of the CS was released. </p>
